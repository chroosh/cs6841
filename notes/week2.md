# Security by Design
Spend resources to factor in security in the initial design of the system instead of
having it factored in as an afterthought or retrofit.

Build something such that if one part breaks the entire system isn't compromised.
Compartmentalisation

Examples: Apollo 11/13, submarines

# Living in complexity
The ant colony itself is a creature - drawing an analogy to human anatomy, our cells
don't make decisions for us, instead it's a collective / emergent property of our selfs

In ant colonies, they all have rigid roles. But ants don't have high IQ's. The reason
why the ant colonies have thrived is because of their inability to disconform to the
rules and structure that has been set.

Now as humans we have free will, and can break out and not follow rules. The complexity
of the human race is borne from our ability to interact with each other by choice.

(Something to think about) Who in the ant colony came up with the ideas?
