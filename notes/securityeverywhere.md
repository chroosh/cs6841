# Doors and people

Fuck the more I think about it the more stupid the world is.

The other day I locked myself out of the office. I had my staff pass with me so I asked
the lady downstairs in admin if she could let me back in. For context, I think it's 
important to know this is a university where all students and staff members are issued
with ID cards that look exactly the same.

I told her which room I would like to get access to and off we went to unlock the room.

Once I was inside I sat down and realised that all you really needed was:
- A lanyard that all staff use to carry their ID's
- An ID card, regardless if student and staff
- Confidence + choosing the right room to enter (you can see if the lights are on/off)

The first one and the third one are probably the hardest to get a hold of/develop. You
could probably find one lying around, or build the confidence to ask/borrow one.

I locked myself out the room again and this time I also went down again to the lady in
the reception. This time she juust gave me the master key to all the rooms in the
building and asked me to go up and unlock it myself.

Not even going to say anything about this one.

Conmen are successful because of the confidence that they possess. Clearly in this case
I wasn't a conman because I actually had access to the room itself, but if you didn't,
this shows it's not especially hard to get access to something you shouldn't if you're
resourceful and confident.

# Frank Abagnale

One of the best examples in my opinion would be that of Frank Abagnale - his antics 
were reenacted in  biopic "Catch Me If You Can" (Hanks, DiCaprio). Abagnale was 
able to pose as a airplane pilot, doctor and lawyer in his teenage years.

Beyond resourcefulness and confidence, he also had an amazing imagination that served
as the driving force behind his strategies. While a teenager, he successfully forged
company cheques issued by Pan American World Airways. To make these cheques he 
required an actual Pan Am logo, which he was able to source from logo stickers found
on Pan Am Boeing 747 model aircraft that he noticed while walking by a shop.

So having the imagination - or the "what if" is so important as well.

# Maccas run
Was at Maccas, and they have deals for mobile users - two to be specific. Was feeling
pretty hungry so I decided to buy both meals. How the Maccas app works is that you
submit the order through your phone and receive an orderID that allows you to pick up
the order from the counter. The app should theoretically issue you with two ID's so 
you can pick both up.

But it doesn't support the display of multiple orderID's. So I could pick up my second
order but not my first order. I kept waiting for my first order but it never came.
After talking to the staff about it they said it wasn't even on the system.

As a result they just decided to make the order on the spot for me and pass it to me.
To be fair, I did have some record of the order in my recent orders section of the app;
just no orderID associated with that order. The order isn't even timestamped so in
theory you could just take a screenshot of that particular screen and present to the
staff and say the exact same thing.
