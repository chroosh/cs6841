# Different types of attacks
- Guided bruteforce = bruteforce with heuristics
- Replay attack = attack on a security protocol using replay of messages from a
different context into the intended/original context. Fooling the honest participants
into thinking they have successfully completed the protocol run.

- Man in the middle = attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters
the communications

## Social Engineering
This is really interesting because it really changes your perspective on what security
actually involves.
