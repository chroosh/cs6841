# Security by Design
Spend resources to factor in security in the initial design of the system instead of
having it factored in as an afterthought or retrofit.

Build something such that if one part breaks the entire system isn't compromised.
Compartmentalisation is great here.

Examples: Apollo 11/13, submarines

# Living in complexity
The ant colony itself is a creature - drawing an analogy to human anatomy, our cells
don't make decisions for us, instead it's a collective / emergent property of our selfs

In ant colonies, they all have rigid roles. But ants don't have high IQ's. The reason
why the ant colonies have thrived is because of their inability to disconform to the
rules and structure that has been set.

Now as humans we have free will, and can break out and not follow rules. The complexity
of the human race is borne from our ability to interact with each other by choice.

(Something to think about) Who in the ant colony came up with the ideas?

# Physical Security
That's actually a good point - although we deal with everything in a virtual world, 
if access to something is granted in the physical world, none of it really matters?

Richard gave a fantastic example of side channels - you could always tell when big
banks were working on big deals by looking at their windows at night. As the deal gets
closer and closer more people's lights are on and you see people walking in and out
during weird times. Wouldn't be especially hard to do some social engineering and then
find out who the deal actually involves - and then you would have insider information.

Now all of this information is closed within the building - but the idea is that traces
are left out in the open world. And this is what it means by "every contact leaves a
trace in the physical world"

So consider physical security measures before software security measures.

# Vignere Cipher
Essentially a Caesar cipher in that the letters are shifted along the alphabet but
instead of shifting the entire text by X, we shift the letters by a predetermined
numerical "password" that loops around.

ABBA = 0, 1, 1, 0
HELLO ==> HFMLO
(+0, +1, +1, +0)

## Kasiski Test
Used to defeat cuphers where password/offset repeats (Vignere) 

Find the length of the key by looking for repetitions, and then line up each section
and solve the lined up letters as a single substitution cipher.

## Index of Coincidence
Indicator used in cryptanalysis to evaluate the global distribution of letters in an
encrypted message for a given alphabet. If the index is high, the message is similar
to plain text (and has probably been encrypted by transposition/monoalphabetic sub)

Transposition sub = letters in a message are moved around. IE - reversed.

If the index is low, then the message is similar to random text and has been encrypted
using a polyalphabetic cipher (letter replaced by multiple other ones)

Formula on notes.

<!--TODO-->
# Enigma Machine
Electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet using
a substitution + almost infinite password.

Weaknesses:
- Repeatedly used stereotypical expressions
- Repetition of message key
- Easily guessed keys
- Re-transmitting a message on different cipher networks
- Not allowing repetitions
