# Week 1

## How to break into a house?

- Enter through the front door/balcony/window? People leave it open/unlock?
(social engineering)
- Disguise-related, dressing up as a council member, fireman (breach of trust)
- Technical vulnerability - smart homes, manufacturing a lock.

Never be certain about anything - only thing I know is that I don't know anything.
Be good with people - you need to be good with people in order to do great things.
- Despite how much coding you need, software is a human construct designed to be used
by people.

Things that happened in Week1
- Russian and tinder
- US and social media (visa)
- Australia spying on its own citizens


## Lecture Case Studies

### Tianenmen Square Massacre

In it's wake, Bob Hawke then Prime Minister allowed all of Chinese students currently
studying in Australia at the time on a student visa automatic asylum. 

<Opinion>
Now this also raises some very interesting concepts on Security, the idea of granting
automatic asylum to people because of political events + the idea of state manipulated
events to influence actions of another state.

There are both positive and negative sides to this right? Both my parents were able 
settle down in Australia after that event but Australia's open (somewhat) policy to
immigrants has both benefits and disadvantages.

Security engineering is a discipline that embraces different opinions and viewpoints
and that is obviously a benefit that stems from supporting a diverse population as the
world transitions into a digital age. (This was the 1980's)

But also this greatly increases the immediate security risk of individuals with
malicious intent manipulating the system to enter the country. As leaders making these
decisions you have very minimal control over the actual physicality of things - the 
micro part of things.

So as a leader you need to be aware of the wider strategy surrounding certain choices
but also be willing to look into the details of specific things.

### Halifax Accident

Prevention: Regulations/compliance? Communication? The Norwegian ship didn't know
that the French ship was laden with explosives? Would it have acted differently if it
knew? Maybe the harbour shouldn't have allowed ships carrying explosives in the first 
place?

[Observation] After major events, media and people in general try to find either a
hero or villain.

Weakness of the Week: Twin Towers/Martin Place Siege
It's hard for people to shift their frame of mind in a short time span. Though I
believe it's something that you can train for. Special forces train themselves to be
able to switch to their danger frame of mind within a short time span. (SAS)
(There was a good book by a SAS operative who goes under a pseudonym Chris Ryan)

Exposing yourself to change more often - sitting in different seats, listening to
different music, etc - is a very effective way to subconsciously train yourself to
respond to different stimuli.

## Bits
A bit is either one or zero - refers to a binary digit.

## Information Security
C - Confidential (message shouldn't be public)
I - Integral (message can't be altered)
A - Authentication (message is actually being sent/delivered to the right people)

Refer to properties that are desirable for a security system to have

## Steganography
The act of concealing a file/message/image within another file/message/image.

Microdots - shrink something really small, put it on the dot an I on a newspaper
and send it to the destination, where someone could take it off and understand it.
As soon as someone finds out about this method, the method is useless, and all 
messages you have ever sent are useless.

Codes vs Ciphers

# Tutorial Case Study - Deepwater Horizon
At the time Deepwater Horizon was drilling an exploratory well about 66km off the
coast of Louisiana at the Macondo Prospect before a blowout (an uncontrolled
release of oil and gas from a drilling well) caused an explosion, leading to an
oil leak of approx 35k - 60k barrels per day.

After a brief analysis and discussion, here are my recommendations to prevent
similar disasters from happening in the future.

1. Tighter and ongoing scrutinisation of risk management plans

There was a plan outlined to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) stating that 
the occurrence of an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would not cause any
significant adverse impact because the well would be 77km from shore. The drilling
of the well was 66km from the shore of Louisiana.

Tighter and ongoing scrutinisation would mean that if the operations of the well 
went beyond the anticipated limits of the initial risk assessment, operations must 
be ceased until a new risk management plan is put together. This includes more
stringent enforcement of all the citations issued by the US Coast Guard.

2. More in-depth inspection/maintenance of blowout preventers + R&D of(BOP)

Blowout Preventers play an integral role in sealing off the wellbore and preventing
material from a blowout (oil/gas/fluid) from reaching the surface and igniting - as
what happened in the Deepwater Horizon accident.

As a result they serve as key equipment in preserving the safety of personel working
onsite, as well as preventing potential disasters. The BOP fitted to Deepwater
Horizon should have been fitted with a remote control or acoustic trigger.

I also believe that because they are critical equipment, the government should
invest more funds into the research and development of BOP technology or equivalent.
A failure of a blowout preventer (as it happened in 2005 on DH) should be heavily
investigated.


3. Improved training of personel and awareness of safety culture

On the day, a BP official directed crew on the rig to replace drilling mud with
lighter seawater to the protest of the rigs chief driller. There were also reports
of BP choosing riskier procedures to save time or money, against the advice of staff
or contractors.

I personally think that engineering mismanagement issues like Deepwater Horizon can
be solved by mandating a compulsory non-technical + technical education for senior
management in the specific field (in this case petroleum/mining engineering).

General training of technical personel in communication and empathy would be helpful
in effectively communicating the potential adverse effects of going against technical
advice for the sake of effiency or profit to management.


4. More stringent checks on rig drilling and safety equipment

A sequence of events caused the Deepwater Horizon explosion. This includes using
nitrogen-foamed cement instead standard cement, which didn't seal in time and caused
a leak through which oil and gas leaked through, the failure of safety valves, the
misinterpretation of pressure tests, failure of the onboard gas detection system.

These systems need to undergo regular testing and checking to make sure that they
can be depended upon during times of crisis. I propose to increase the frequency
at which all drilling and safety equipment is checked and the quality to which it is
checked at.

5. More regular rehearsals of crisis management

I think it's impossible for the environmental risks associated with these operations
to be completely diminished. It's important that protocols and mulitple fail safes
are developed to contain the environmental impact even in extremely unlikely scenarios.

The Secret Service has specific protocols to deal with extremely unlikely events should
they occur. I believe environment crisis management could take a leaf out of their book.
