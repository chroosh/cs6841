# How to break into a house?

- Enter through the front door/balcony/window? People leave it open/unlock?
(social engineering)
- Disguise-related, dressing up as a council member, fireman (breach of trust)
- Technical vulnerability - smart homes, manufacturing a lock.

Never be certain about anything - only thing I know is that I don't know anything.
Be good with people - you need to be good with people in order to do great things.
- Despite how much coding you need, software is a human construct designed to be used
by people.

# Case Studies

## Tianenmen Square Massacre

In it's wake, Bob Hawke then Prime Minister allowed all of Chinese students currently
studying in Australia at the time on a student visa automatic asylum. 

<Opinion>
Now this also raises some very interesting concepts on Security, the idea of granting
automatic asylum to people because of political events + the idea of state manipulated
events to influence actions of another state.

There are both positive and negative sides to this right? Both my parents were able 
settle down in Australia after that event but Australia's open (somewhat) policy to
immigrants has both benefits and disadvantages.

Security engineering is a discipline that embraces different opinions and viewpoints
and that is obviously a benefit that stems from supporting a diverse population as the
world transitions into a digital age. (This was the 1980's)

But also this greatly increases the immediate security risk of individuals with
malicious intent manipulating the system to enter the country. As leaders making these
decisions you have very minimal control over the actual physicality of things - the 
micro part of things.

So as a leader you need to be aware of the wider strategy surrounding certain choices
but also be willing to look into the details of specific things.

## Halifax Accident

Prevention: Regulations/compliance? Communication? The Norwegian ship didn't know
that the French ship was laden with explosives? Would it have acted differently if it
knew? Maybe the harbour shouldn't have allowed ships carrying explosives in the first 
place?

[Observation] After major events, media and people in general try to find either a
hero or villain.

Weakness of the Week: Twin Towers/Martin Place Siege
It's hard for people to shift their frame of mind in a short time span. Though I
believe it's something that you can train for. Special forces train themselves to be
able to switch to their danger frame of mind within a short time span. (SAS)
(There was a good book by a SAS operative who goes under a pseudonym Chris Ryan)

Exposing yourself to change more often - sitting in different seats, listening to
different music, etc - is a very effective way to subconsciously train yourself to
respond to different stimuli.

# Bits
A bit is either one or zero - refers to a binary digit.

# Information Security
C - Confidential (message shouldn't be public)
I - Integral (message can't be altered)
A - Authentication (message is actually being sent/delivered to the right people)

Refer to properties that are desirable for a security system to have

# Steganography
The act of concealing a file/message/image within another file/message/image.

Microdots - shrink something really small, put it on the dot an I on a newspaper
and send it to the destination, where someone could take it off and understand it.
As soon as someone finds out about this method, the method is useless, and all 
messages you have ever sent are useless.
