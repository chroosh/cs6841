# Doors and people

Fuck the more I think about it the more stupid the world is.

The other day I locked myself out of the office. I had my staff pass with me so I asked
the lady downstairs in admin if she could let me back in. For context, I think it's 
important to know this is a university where all students and staff members are issued
with ID cards that look exactly the same.

I told her which room I would like to get access to and off we went to unlock the room.

Once I was inside I sat down and realised that all you really needed was:
- A lanyard that all staff use to carry their ID's
- An ID card, regardless if student and staff
- Confidence + choosing the right room to enter (you can see if the lights are on/off)

The first one and the third one are probably the hardest to get a hold of/develop. You
could probably find one lying around, or build the confidence to ask/borrow one.

I locked myself out the room again and this time I also went down again to the lady in
the reception. This time she juust gave me the master key to all the rooms in the
building and asked me to go up and unlock it myself.

Not even going to say anything about this one.

Conmen are successful because of the confidence that they possess. Clearly in this case
I wasn't a conman because I actually had access to the room itself, but if you didn't,
this shows it's not especially hard to get access to something you shouldn't if you're
resourceful and confident.

# Frank Abagnale

One of the best examples in my opinion would be that of Frank Abagnale - his antics 
were reenacted in the biopic "Catch Me If You Can" (Hanks, DiCaprio). Abagnale was 
able to pose as a airplane pilot, doctor and lawyer in his teenage years.

Beyond resourcefulness and confidence, he also had an amazing imagination that served
as the driving force behind his strategies. While a teenager, he successfully forged
company cheques issued by Pan American World Airways. To make these cheques he 
required an actual Pan Am logo, which he was able to source from logo stickers found
on Pan Am Boeing 747 model aircraft that he noticed while walking by a shop.

So having the imagination - or the "what if" is so important as well.

Too many people also tend to follow social norm from a young age and not think about
whether if something could be "what if" or otherwise. I think it's important to 
nurture imagination. It's also a quality I think Richard said makes a good security
engineer.

The real Frank Abagnale also gave a talk something you notice about him is that all
of his talks are the same. But he speaks in a certain way - very fast and with few
pauses - it prevents the average listener from stopping and thinking about the stuff
he just said.

He also mentioned during the talk that it is even easier to do all the things he did
all those years ago, but just in different ways. The technology has made things a lot
easier than it was 30 years ago. He gave an example of just how easy it is to digitally 
scan a CEO/CFO/COO signature and paste that onto a cheque. (His specialty was in 
cheque forgery)

I think that is definitely true. All you need is to look for the ways and have a little
confidence.

# Maccas run 
Was at Maccas, and they have deals for mobile users - two to be specific. 
Was feeling retty hungry so I decided to buy both meals. How the Maccas app works is 
that you submit the order through your phone and receive an orderID that allows you 
to pick up the order from the counter. The app should theoretically issue you with 
two ID's so you can pick both up.

But it doesn't support the display of multiple orderID's. So I could pick up my second
order but not my first order. I kept waiting for my first order but it never came.
After talking to the staff about it they said it wasn't even on the system.

As a result they just decided to make the order on the spot for me and pass it to me.
To be fair, I did have some record of the order in my recent orders section of the app;
just no orderID associated with that order. The order isn't even timestamped so in
theory you could just take a screenshot of that particular screen and present to the
staff and say the exact same thing.

# Quid pro pro social engineering
Needed a specific email at work so I decided to ask around some people if they know it.
Turns out this person is incredibly elusive. I remembered that a while back someone from
his office had purchased an item from us and is awaiting a proper invoice so that she
can reconcile expenses from her side. In short - I quickly made an invoice and sent it
off to her - adding in a note to also ask if she could do me a favour by passing on a 
message or an email. And that worked!

Funnily enough. Quid pro pro is I think one of the more common social engineering
techniques that is used a lot in corporate/political manipulation.

Something I noticed is that also - I didn't get around to processing the invoice when I
first knew about it, and I just left it on and on. If I originally processed the invoice
it wouldn't be quid pro pro - I would just have to ask for it outright. But then I
probably would've still used the technique to some extent (for something already received)

# Finding information
There was a really good section in the Week 2 lecture where Richard talks about how you
can tell when the banks are working on a big deal by looking at how many lights are on
on the building at really late hours.

I'm not particularly fond of watching office buildings for nights on end so I tried to
do a quick google of M&A deals performed by large investment banks over the course of the
last financial year.

And there's nothing there - surprisingly, even for completed deals.

This also ties into an earlier piece that I wrote about Frank Abagnale and how he thinks
that technology has made it easier for us to impersonate other people/gather information.

I think the problem that most people will face is they don't know that information to 
gather. The signature example he gave was "white glossy paper, black ink, camera[something]
, scan it, digitise it". Thing is - the average person doesn't know any of that and this
is only knowledge that manifests itself over years and years of experience in the field.

Note that this was a person who was at his "criminal" peak in the 1970's - but still has
the knowledge of how to carry out something similar in today's vastly more digital age.

I think, the techniques to manipulate information/people/encryption are the same. IE, the
act of copying a signature. It's just how you go about copying a signature that changes
subtly over the decades. And if you keep up from time to time you won't fall out of touch
in terms of a decade or something.

# Chernobyl
Referring to the HBO miniseries. This is a fantastic TV show and is a must watch for this
course and the understanding of building security into a system from the beginning instead
of an afterthought.

Context: The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was caused by the ignorance of Soviet leadership
in overlooking the design flaws of the RBMK nuclear reactor design developed in the Soviet
Union in the 1950's. This, combined with more lack of oversight in nuclear staff management
and general mismanagement caused the reactor to enter a uncontrollable chain reaction that
generated a vast amount of steam inside the reactor - the steam pressure eventually caused
the reactor to explode and mix with oxygen - starting a nuclear fire that distributed radio-
active material across Ukraine, Belaruse and Russia.

Lessons learned:
- In general, being honest, open, vocal and accepting of criticism over pride.
- Developing better training programs for staff
- Developing better systems for nuclear crisis meltdown - don't use cost as a driving factor
in influencing design decisions for safety critical systems.
