# Risk
The moral question raised by what something is vs what something should be is actually 
very interesting.

Going back to the example of the space shuttles that was briefly discussed last week:
- The launch window of STL-51 Challenger should have been pushed back until the 
temperature weren't too cold for the O-rings to handle. SHOULD HAVE - but wasn't.
- The return of STS-107 Columbia should have been handled differently in a way that
didn't compromise the safety and lives of the astronauts. Again - it wasn't.

These are examples of management-engineering disconnects, something that I'm 
personally very interested about.

There are a couple things we as humans are bad at:
- It's hard for us to empathise with other people and equally hard for us to make
people empathise with us. As we grow up we are groomed to do things that benefit us
as individuals - not as a group - not as a species. Because of hard it is to empathise
with each other, it's also harder to communicate things properly to each other.
- It's hard for us to calculate. We're not computers and our logic is not discrete.
I think that is why we are bad on making decisions about risk based on "past life
experiences"

Going back to management-engineering disconnects. I don't think anyone wants to live
in an environment where these unavoidable and trivial mistakes are made.

The clear and obvious (but inefficient) solution is to mandate a compulsory technical
+ non technical education for all leaders and key decision makers. I've spoken to a 
few people on both sides of the fence - the engineer that despises corporate management
and the management who believe that engineers are swappable units. Neither side agrees
that this is the best solution because neither side wants to learn about either side.

There is no empathy involved in this equation. (Spoken in a more general sense)
(Not specifically addressing the space shuttle accidents.)

Find me if you want to talk more about it - open to all opinions :)

# Measuring information in bits
1 bit of info distinguishes between 2 cases
2 bits = 4 cases

Bits of security = a cipher takes n operations to solve. This can be written in terms
of 2^x where x is the number of bits of security required to solve a problem.
