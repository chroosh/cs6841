## Analytical ability

Throughout the trimester I encouraged myself to research a bit about contemporary
security. I did quite a bit of research and probing of some outstanding examples of
vulnerability exploitation in the 1970's (Frank Abagnale) and even discovered some
examples of social engineering behaviour while undertaking modern day tasks.

A lot of the cases where I discovered examples of social engineering and behaviour
I decided to document them down and list them below. In many cases I was also able
to apply theory to practise and see some really cool // alarming outcomes.

### Security Everywhere
Getting access into an office that I shouldn't have access to:

I watched a movie called Catch Me If You Can - a biopic of Frank Abagnale

I decided to order multiple maccas orders at once and see what happened

## Time management
I'm not that great at time management since I've put myself into a lot of
committments (work and outside of work) that limits the amount of time I can spend
on this course. I really wanted to spend more time on it but just could never find
myself doing so.

As the term progressed I tried to put together plans to make sure I could complete
the most amount of work I could.

Unfortunately this was around Week 7. I ran a hackathon at university on the weekend
between 6 and 7 and I used this time to spread out my progress on my Something
Awesome project.

My plan was as follows:
20th July: fd[x], col[x], bof[x], flag[x], passcode[x], random
21st July: input[x], leg[x], mistake[x], shellshock[x], coin1[x], blackjack[x], lotto[x], random[x]
22nd July: cmd1[x], cmd2[x], uaf[x], memcpy, asm, unlink, blukat, horcruxes
(it was here that I realised that these challenges were not pieces of cake)
23rd July: memcpy[x], asm[x], blukat[x], unlink, horcruxes
24th July: fsb[X] - I decided to just see if I can tackle a Rookiss challenge.

I recorded my observations of security everywhere throughout the term as well.
Some of them don't have any dates because of the nature of their observation but I
have been talking about them with Caff so he knows some of them - like the master
key one.

## Skills
Through doing my Something Awesome project I learnt a lot about how programs are
executed at an assembly level. I've taken an assembly + operating systems course
and have scored reasonably okay at them in the past. But doing the pwnable.kr 
challenges / or in some cases, looking at how other people did these challenges
really opened up my eyes. I think being able to document all of them really helped
my understanding as well.

Here are some of the blog links that really demonstrate how much I've learnt:

- fsb challenge (format strings, gdb, x86 syntax, addresses, stack manipulation)

- asm challenge (x64 shellcode, linux x64 syscalls, pwntools)
https://imfallingbehind.tumblr.com/post/186503640537/asm
- uaf challenge (c++ objects, vtables and memory, assembly, use after free, redare2)
https://imfallingbehind.tumblr.com/post/186503383157/uaf
- coin1 challenge (binary search, pwntools)

- shellshock (vulnerability history)
