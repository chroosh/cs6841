# Doors and people

Fuck the more I think about it the more stupid the world is.

The other day I locked myself out of the office. I had my staff pass with me so I asked
the lady downstairs in admin if she could let me back in. For context, I think it's 
important to know this is a university where all students and staff members are issued
with ID cards that look exactly the same.

I told her which room I would like to get access to and off we went to unlock the room.

Once I was inside I sat down and realised that all you really needed was:
- A lanyard that all staff use to carry their ID's
- An ID card, regardless if student and staff
- Confidence + choosing the right room to enter (you can see if the lights are on/off)

The first one and the third one are probably the hardest to get a hold of/develop. You
could probably find one lying around, or build the confidence to ask/borrow one.

Conmen are successful because of the confidence that they possess. Clearly in this case
I wasn't a conman because I actually had access to the room itself, but if you didn't,
this shows it's not especially hard to get access to something you shouldn't if you're
resourceful and confident.

# Frank Abagnale

One of the best examples in my opinion would be that of Frank Abagnale - his antics 
were reenacted in  biopic "Catch Me If You Can" (Hanks, DiCaprio). Abagnale was 
able to pose as a airplane pilot, doctor and lawyer in his teenage years.

Beyond resourcefulness and confidence, he also had an amazing imagination that served
as the driving force behind his strategies. While a teenager, he successfully forged
company cheques issued by Pan American World Airways. To make these cheques he 
required an actual Pan Am logo, which he was able to source from logo stickers found
on Pan Am Boeing 747 model aircraft that he noticed while walking by a shop.

So having the imagination - or the "what if" is so important as well.
