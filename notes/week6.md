Minister to produce 10 recommendations for actions to be taken regarding the main 
threats we face in the cyber domain of war.

1. Updating legacy infrastructure (especially infrastructure involved in essential 
functioning of society - utilities, etc) to modern equivalents.
2. Build creative and isolated redundancy systems for communication and navigation

4. Setting up an official public channels that verifies news to the public. Removes 
mis-information and fake news.

6. Strengthen politcal and diplomatic ties with other countries to prevent potential 
attacks.
7. Securing critical research and intelligence facilities. (?)
8. Investing in security education at secondary + tertiary levels. Allows the gov
